# Backbone Unclassified

Declarative child elements for Backbone Views.

## Why?

Backbone doesn't come with a way of managing a View's child elements. If you want to use all of Backbone's great features, like its event declaration syntax, you either have to write selectors multiple times or save the selectors elsewhere for later use. Or your can forgo using Backbone's niceties altogether and do everything the hard way (manually). But where's the fun in that?
